### Hi there 👋

I'm Blaise, a web developer intern 💻 currently working at [AHS](https://ahs.ca) 🍲🥡

 I've been using C#, NodeJS, Java, and React to built my projects and I really enjoy the ease of use these backend languages, it's developer experience, as well the community supporting this languages.

My current side project is [Covid19 Vaccination Tracker](https://covid-vaccination-tracker-server-yiqc5.ondigitalocean.app/)
